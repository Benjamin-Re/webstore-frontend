# Description

**Shopping cArt** is a webstore for art and art supplies. After successful signup/login the user can shop. The user can add products to the cart, increase, decrease their quantity and buy them.  The order is added to the user instance as a property. Whenever an order is placed, the stock quantity for the product is decreased. If no more items are available, the product is listed as "Sold Out". In the user dashboard the user can see past orders, profile details and change profile details if needed. 

In addition the store owner can sign in as admin and add, modify or delete products without having to access the database. The owner can specify name, price, amount of units in stock, and add an image for the product. 

You can see and use the app running here on Heroku: https://shopping-art-555.herokuapp.com/
