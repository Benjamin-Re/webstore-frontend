Webstore
A website where a user can browser products, sign up, log in, add products to his cart, increase and decrease their quantity, and buy them.
The signup is a form with the fields
- shipping address
- name
- email
- payment method
- password

The user has to be signed in to complete checkeout process.

After a sucessful checkout an order confirmation should be displayed to the user. And possibly a confirmation email should be sent as well.

The user should be able to change his details after signing up.

There should also be an admin login, so the shop owner can add products without touching any code or the database directly.
The admin could also keep track of customers and orders this way.
